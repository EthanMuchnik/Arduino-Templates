// OUTPUT: Make electricity flow. INPUT reads the amount of electricity flowing       
// pinMode(): makes a pin  an INPUT or OUTPUT. Always goes in setup

// Serial.begin(): Sets up the printing area.
// Serial.println(): Prints thing sto the printing area 
// Delay(miliseconds): Keeps the same state for a certain amount of time
// If the button is pressed 1 is printed. Otherwise 0 is printed.

//Make the LED1, LED2, buzzer, read, and button pin variables
