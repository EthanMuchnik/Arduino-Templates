//                             Project: Police Car
// Make a mini police siren. 
//        - Two LEDs(Blue and Red) should go from being on and off 
//        - While a buzzer goes from a high frequency to a low frequncy
//        - THis should happen every 0.2 seconds(200 miliseconds)
//        - This should go on forever
//


//                            Things to Rememeber
// HIGH: makes electricity go.            LOW: makes no electricity go.
// OUTPUT: Make electricity flow.         INPUT: reads the amount of electricity flowing       
// delay(milliseconds): Countinues the current action for a certain amount of milliseconds      ||     1000 milliseconds = 1 second
// pinMode(pin, OUPUT/INPUT): makes a pin  an INPUT or OUTPUT. 
// digitalWrite(pin, HIGH/LOW): Makes a pin Output HIGH or LOW. 
// tone(pin, frequency): Takes in the pin and then the frequency to play a certain note
// noTone(pin): This simply ends your song/buzz

// Int format:            int variableName = number;
// String format:         String variableName = “word”;

// Setup Runs Once
// Loop never stops running
// declare variables that are used in both functions outside of them




// Make the BlueLED, RedLED and Buzzer pin variables

void setup() 
{
  //Set the pinMode of BlueLED, RedLED and Buzzer pins

}

void loop() 
{ 
  //  First make the buzzer buzz at a high frequency

  //  The first LED on

  //  The second LED off

  //  Keep that state for a certain time


  
  //  First make the buzzer buzz at a lower frequency

  //  The first LED off 

  //  The second LED on

  //  Keep that state for a certain time

}
