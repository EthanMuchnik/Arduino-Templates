//                             Project: Police Car
// Make a mini police siren. 
//        - Two LEDs(Blue and Red) should go from being on and off 
//        - While a buzzer goes from a high frequency to a low frequncy
//        - This shoud go on forever
//


//                            Things to Rememeber
// HIGH: makes electricity go.            LOW: makes no electricity go.
// OUTPUT: Make electricity flow.         INPUT: reads the amount of electricity flowing       
// delay(miliseconds): Countinues the current action for a certain amount of miliseconds      ||     1000 miliseconds = 1 second
// pinMode(pin, OUPUT/INPUT): makes a pin  an INPUT or OUTPUT. 
// digitalWrite(pin, HIGH/LOW): Makes a pin Output HIGH or LOW. 
// tone(pin, frequency): Takes in the pin and then the frequency to play a certain note
// pinMode(pin, OUPUT/INPUT): makes a pin  an INPUT or OUTPUT. 

// Int format:            int variableName = number;
// String format:         String variableName = “word”;

//Setup Runs Once
//Loop never stops running
//declare variables that are used in both functions outside of them

//Make the BlueLED, RedLED and Buzzer pin variables





void setup() 
{
  //Set the pinMode of BlueLED, RedLED and Buzzer pins
}

void loop() 
{ 
  //  First make the buzzer buzz at a certain frequency
  //  The first LED on, 
  //  The second LED off
  //  Keep that state for a certain time
  
  //  First make the buzzer buzz at a different frequency
  //  The first LED off, 
  //  The second LED on
  //  Keep that state for a certain time
}
