//                            Things to Rememeber
// HIGH makes electricity go. LOW makes no electricity go.
// OUTPUT: Make electricity flow. INPUT reads the amount of electricity flowing       
// pinMode(): makes a pin  an INPUT or OUTPUT. Always goes in setup 
// digitialWrite(): Makes a pin HIGH or LOW. Usually goes in loop
// Serial.begin(): Sets up the printing area.
// Serial.println(): Prints thing sto the printing area 
// Delay(miliseconds): Keeps the same state for a certain amount of time
// If the button is pressed 1 is printed. Otherwise 0 is printed.



//Make the LED1, LED2 and Buzzer pin variables

void setup() {
//Set the pinMode of LED1, LED2 and Buzzer pins
}

void loop() {
  
//  First make the buzzer buzz 
//  The first LED on, 
//  The second LED off
//  Keep that state for a certain time

//  First make the buzzer buzz at a differen frequency
//  The first LED off, 
//  The second LED on
//  Keep that state for a certain time
