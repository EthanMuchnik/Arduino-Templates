//                       Mini Project: Forever LED
// Your code should make an LED turn on forever.

//                            Things to Rememeber
// HIGH: makes electricity go.            LOW: makes no electricity go.
// OUTPUT: Make electricity flow.         INPUT: reads the amount of electricity flowing       
// delay(miliseconds): Countinues the current action for a certain amount of miliseconds      ||     1000 miliseconds = 1 seconds
// pinMode(pin, OUPUT/LOW): makes a pin  an INPUT or OUTPUT. 
// digitalWrite(pin, HIGH/LOW): Makes a pin Output HIGH or LOW. 

//Setup Runs Once
//Loop never stops running
//declare variables that are used in both functions outside of them



int pin = ;  // Write the pin that your wire is plugged into (2-13).

void setup() {
  pinMode(pin,);  // Write INPUT or OUTPUT. 
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(pin,);  // Turn the LED on. Write HIGH or LOW.
}
