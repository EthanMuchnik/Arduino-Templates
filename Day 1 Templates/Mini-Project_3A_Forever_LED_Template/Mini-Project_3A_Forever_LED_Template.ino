//                       Mini Project: Forever LED
// Your code should make an LED turn on forever.

//                            Things to Rememeber
// HIGH makes electricity go. LOW makes no electricity go.
// OUTPUT: Make electricity flow. INPUT reads the amount of electricity flowing       
// Delay: Countinues the current action for a certain emount of miliseconds
// pinMode(): makes a pin  an INPUT or OUTPUT. Always goes in setup 
// digitialWrite(): Makes a pin HIGH or LOW. Usually goes in loop

//Setup Runs Once
//Loop never stops running
//declare variables that are used in both functions outside of them



int pin = ;// Write the pin that your wire is plugged into. (2-13)

void setup() {
  pinMode(pin,);// Write INPUT or OUTPUT. 
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(pin,);   // turn the LED on. Write HIGH or LOW.
}
