//Everything written on the same line after two forward slashes is not actual code.
//These are just comments where you can read instructions or take notes to explain what your code does.

//                    WHAT IS THIS TEMPLATE?
//This is a blank template that will be standard for all Arduino Code.

//                    WHAT IS INSIDE OF THIS TEMPLATE?
//There are two functions. A function consists of its name - for example: setup: - and what goes inside of the curly brackets.

void setup() {
  // The arduino only does what is inside of the function once.
  // The code should be in between the two curly brackets.   
}

void loop() {
  // The arduino keeps repeating the code inside of this function. 
  // The code should be in between the two curly brackets.   
}
