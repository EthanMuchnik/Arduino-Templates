//Everything written on the same line after two forward slashes is not going to run and go to the arduino. 
//These are just comments where you can read instructions or take notes to explain what your code does.

//                    WHAT IS THIS TEMPLATE?
//This is a blank template that will be standard for all Arduino Code

                      WHAT IS INSIDE OF THIS TEMPLATE?
//There are two functions. A function consists of its name - for example: setup: - and what goes inside of the curly brackets.

void setup() {
  // The arduino only does what is inside of setup once. That means you use this to simply set up the code.
}

void loop() {
  // The arduino keeps repeating the inside of this function. If you want a light to constantely check if it should be on, here is the place to do it.
}
